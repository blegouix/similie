----- TODO -----

- sil::tensor::detail::Access implementation is not complete 
- Avoid usage of std::array in non-constexpr tensor_impl function (exclusive to YoungTableauIndexing)
- Partial CTAD works for function. Check if it can simplify some implementations
- Primary-specialization is given by not writing <>. Maybe it can simplify some implementation
- tests for relabelize_indexes and relabelize_metric
- Unify TensorAccessor::access_element() functions. Also get<Dims...>() in Tensor ?
- Consider creating a misc enum for {-1 1} and use it in simplices/chains
- enforced_deep_copy (avoid call to Kokkos::deep_copy)
- Consider removing metric_prod_t (and every helper producing a tensor). At least, standardize API.
- Relabelizion in different file ?
- Streams in Laplacian
- There are several projection of metric on MetricIndex which is simply a metric.indices_domain()
- swap_character_t
